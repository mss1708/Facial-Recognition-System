Designed and implemented a real-time face recognition attendance system using OpenCV and deep learning (FaceNet) to
automate attendance tracking with high accuracy.
• Developed a robust facial embedding and classification pipeline using KNN for identity matching, improving efficiency
and reducing false positives.
• Engineered a modular Python application integrating live webcam feed, attendance logging, and user feedback
mechanisms with a clean, maintainable codebase.
• Optimized system performance and usability through rigorous testing and debugging of core modules (main.py, util.py,
and test.py), ensuring smooth real-world operation# Facial-Recognition-System.
